## üöÄ Featured Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects:

1. **[Manufacturing Defects Prediction](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Manufacturing-Defects.git)**  
   - Description: [This project focuses on analyzing manufacturing defects and predicting the severity of defects based on various factors such as defect type, location, and inspection method].
   - Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, xgboost   
   - Highlights: [Achieved a prediction accuracy of 85% for defect severity. Recommendations led to a 12% reduction in overall defect rates by optimizing processes].

2. **[Predictive Maintenance](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Predictive-Maintenance-using-Machine-Learning.git)**  
   - Description: [This project focuses on predictive maintenance using machine learning to forecast machinery failures based on historical sensor data. ].  
   - Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
   - Highlights: [Achieved 90% precision in predicting failures, allowing for timely preventive maintenance. Reduced downtime by 25% and maintenance costs by 15%.].
  
3. **[Process Optimization](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Process-Optimization.git)**  
   - Description: [This project focuses on analyzing data from a multi-stage continuous manufacturing process to identify bottlenecks, predict output measurements, and suggest process optimizations].
   - Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
   - Highlights: [Identified bottlenecks in stages 2 and 4, reducing overall cycle time by 18%. Improved resource allocation increased throughput by 10%].

4. **[Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Mall-Customer-Segmentation.git)**  
   - Description: [This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on their characteristics from a retail dataset].  
   - Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib   
   - Highlights: [Identified five distinct segments of customers that can help the business tailor marketing strategies].
  
5. **[Global Trends Dashboard](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Global-Trends-Dashbord.git)**  
   - Description: [Brief description of the project, e.g., Predicting customer churn using machine learning].
   - Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
   - Highlights: [This is part of the Current Project (Global Trends 2040) series. This project is expected to be completed by March 2025].

6. **[Credit Scoring Model](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Credit-Risk-Scoring.git)**  
   - Description: [This section of the Global Trends project examines key demographic, economic, environmental, and technological factors in North America].  
   - Tech Stack: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
   - Highlights: [High 93.92% accuracy and 0.86 AUC-ROC score indicate the model is effective at identifying safe clients, minimizing false positives in lending decisions].
